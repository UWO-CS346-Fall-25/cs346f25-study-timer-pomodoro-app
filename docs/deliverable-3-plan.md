# Week 9 Plan – Deliverable 3

1. At least one working form (e.g., signup, contact, or data input)
   - Includes 3+ input types (text, select, checkbox, etc.)
   - Uses basic client-side validation (required, length, email pattern, etc.)
   - Submits to a new Express route or logs data temporarily.
2. Add at least three visible UI improvements, such as:
   - A CSS animation or hover effect.
   - Improved spacing, color palette, or typography.
   - A responsive layout that adapts to mobile viewports.
3. Keep MVC organization intact — no inline CSS or logic in EJS.
4. Update your README with screenshots and a 2-sentence description of the
   improvements.
