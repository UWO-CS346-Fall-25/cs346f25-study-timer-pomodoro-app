# Deliverable 1 Page Plan

## Page Inventory
- **Home (`/`)**  
  Hero overview of the Pomodoro study timer, feature highlights, and quick-start steps.
- **Focus Sessions (`/focus`)**  
  Static mock of the timer layout showing focus/break controls and schedule cards.
- **Progress Insights (`/insights`)**  
  Placeholder dashboard with summary metrics, session history list, and tips panel.
- **About (`/about`)**  
  Team introduction, project goals, and links to supporting resources.

## Shared Layout Notes
- Top navigation with logo and links to the four pages above; highlight active page.
- Footer with project name, semester, and contact placeholder.
- Responsive container width (max ~1200px) with generous vertical spacing between sections.

## Visual Direction
- Color palette from `webcolorused.pdf`: `#FCEFEF`, `#7FD8BE`, `#A1FCDF`, `#FCD29F`, `#FCAB64`.
- Rounded cards, soft shadows, large typography for hero, friendly sans-serif font.
- Sections grouped: hero → feature cards → how-it-works timeline → testimonials/cta (home); cards + two-column layout on other pages.

## Assets & Next Steps
- Placeholder illustrations/icons can use emoji until custom graphics are ready.
- Final styling and responsive tweaks will be handled in CSS pass.
- Capture screenshots once CSS polish is complete for README update.
